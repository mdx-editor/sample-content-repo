# Roadmap

Below you can get an overview of the short-to-mid-term ideas for the project.

## Support for file/image upload

Links to additional assets and images are common part of the markdown content. Soon, the app will let you drag and drop images in the editor and upload them to a location of your choice - either in the cloud or inside the repository. 

## Editor configuration and customization

The MDXEditor is highly customizable. 
## More GitHub oriented features
